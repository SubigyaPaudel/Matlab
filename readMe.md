Matlab

This project involves moving spaceships and robots which are mere collections of geometric shapes in matlab through the continuous application of homogenous transformation matrices. This project taught me how to model simple robots in Matlab and change the value of the degree of freedoms of their joints by creating and multiplying the joint values with Homogenpous transforms, representing rotation and translation"
